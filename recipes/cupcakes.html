    <p class="cupc-desc">This vanilla cupcake recipe will blow your mind! I know this is a strong statement but they are so moist and bursting with vanilla flavor, you just won't believe it! They're nothing like those dry ultra fluffy bakery cupcakes they make you <strong>sad</strong> and full of regret, these are worth it!</p>
    <h3 class="cupc-ing">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="cupc-inglist">
        <li>Plain flour</li>
        <li>Eggs at room temperature, not fridge cold</li>
        <li>Baking powder</li>
        <li>Milk, full fat</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
        <li>Vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="cupc-steplist">Steps</h3>
    <Ol class="cupc-steps">
        <li>Use a handheld beater instead of a stand mixer - for small batch batters like this, it comes together better using a handheld beater you can move around the bowl rather than a large stand mixer bowl. If using a stand mixer, you'll need to scrape down the sides and base well to ensure the batter comes together evenly. There is no excess batter in this recipe!</li>
        <li>Beat the eggs with sugar for a whole 7 minutes until thick and glossy, it changes from yellow to white, and tripled in volume (just over double depth in the bowl).</li>
        <li>Whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the flour mixture into the egg mixture in 3 lots, mixing for just 5 seconds on Speed 1 in between. This should make the flour just incorporated - don't worry if there are some streaks on the bowl not mixed in. Key here is minimum mixing!</li>
        <li>Melt butter and heat milk - use a microwave or stove to heat milk with the butter until it melts. HOT milk helps with rise for these cupcakes.</li>
        <li>Mix some batter into hot milk (tempering) - this serves two purposes: bring down the temperature of the hot milk so it won't “cook” the eggs (ie. tempering); and it lightens up the density of the hot milk (see above - it becomes foamy) so it blends together faster when added to the rest of the whipped egg mixture.</li>
        <li>Slowly pour milk mixture back into whipped eggs over 15 seconds while beating on the lowest speed. Scrape down sides of bowl, then mix for 10 seconds.</li>
        <li>Bake 22 minutes until golden and a toothpick inserted into the centre comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Remove after 2 minutes. Rest for just 2 minutes to let them cool slightly, then get them out of the muffin tin asap otherwise they will continue cooking and may overcook. Cupcakes are small, they overcook easily!</li>
